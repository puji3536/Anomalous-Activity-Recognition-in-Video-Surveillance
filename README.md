This Project is designed to detect abnormalities in video streams by leveraging deep
learning techniques, enabling real-time identification of unusual events that deviate from
expected patterns. By analyzing key features such as object movements, and behavioral patterns,
the model effectively monitors and understands complex video environments. The system is built
to continuously learn and adapt to environmental changes, enhancing its accuracy and reliability
over time. This makes it highly effective for applications in security, surveillance, and automated
monitoring, where rapid and precise anomaly detection is crucial for proactive response and
decision-making.
